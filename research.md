## Research and Design Inspiration

My initial idea was to create a film recommendation website, with a social element to it. I was inspired by **Letterboxd** and **JustWatch**, and initially wanted to create a website which blended elements of both sites, such as the ability for users to review movies and to also find movie recommendations.

[JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com/)

However, due to time constraints and the level of complexity involved in implementing such a website, I decided to change the scope of the project towards more of a movie blog style website.

The following are various design elements that have inspired my Film Buzz website:

### From [Jason's Movie Blog](https://jasonsmovieblog.com/)

I was heavily inspired by Jason’s Movie Blog website, which is a simple but well designed website. The website provided me with the inspiration for the **Navigation** and **Header** elements sections on my own website.

### From Creative Tim

I was inspired by the following UI design of a blog page I came across on [Creative Tim](https://demos.creative-tim.com/now-ui-design-system-pro/pages/blog/author.html). The design helped shape the basic UI structure for the Profile page I created on my website.
