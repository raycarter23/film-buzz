        <ul class="list-disc flex flex-col gap-4 text-lg">
            <li>The shortest Oscar speech ever was just two words! When actress Patty Duke won Best Supporting Actress
                in 1963, she simply said, “Thank you.”</li>
            <li>Popcorn and movies weren’t always a pair – theaters initially banned snacks to avoid messy floors. Now,
                popcorn is the ultimate movie-time treat!</li>
            <li>The iconic ghost noises in “The Grudge” were made by the film's director, Takashi Shimizu, who performed
                them himself for authenticity.</li>
            <li>The MGM lion roar? It wasn’t recorded in a jungle. It was captured in a studio with a very brave sound
                technician nearby.</li>
            <li>Tom Hanks didn’t get paid for “Forrest Gump” – instead, he opted for a percentage of the film's
                earnings. This decision earned him over $60 million!</li>
            <li>The tiger in “Life of Pi” wasn’t all CGI. Four real Bengal tigers were used for specific close-up shots,
                combined seamlessly with visual effects.</li>
            <li>“The Matrix” code you see on-screen? It’s actually sushi recipes scanned from a Japanese cookbook!</li>
            <li>Buzz Lightyear’s name in Toy Story is a tribute to real-life astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second person to
                walk on the moon.</li>
            <li>Spider-Man’s famous upside-down kiss was harder than it looked – Tobey Maguire could barely breathe with
                rainwater pouring into his nose!</li>
            <li>The shark in “Jaws” was so fake-looking, the crew nicknamed it “Bruce.” Despite its flaws, the suspense
                made it one of the most terrifying movies ever!</li>
